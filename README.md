# Simple-CenterNet
This is a simple reimplement for the paper [centernet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07850.pdf). This repo can't achieve the same metrics as paper, it's a simple reimplement version, but you can read this code to learn how the algorithm work, and I write a **jupyter-notebook** inference code for inference visilization.

### requirements
- pytorch >= 1.3 & torchvision
- pycocotools
- opencv-python

### heat map visualization
